    "\n",
    "In the atmosphere, _microphysics_ refers to the microscale processes that affect cloud and precipitation particles and is a key linkage among the various components of Earth's atmospheric water and energy cycles. The representation of microphysical processes in models continues to pose a major challenge leading to uncertainty in numerical weather forecasts and climate simulations. \n",

    "The main question we pose is:\n",

    "- how to represent the population of cloud and precipitation particles, given the impossibility of simulating all particles individually within a cloud?\n",
    "\n",
    "Models that attempt at describing _all_ micro processes in clouds can be extremely complex. See the following sketch: \n",
