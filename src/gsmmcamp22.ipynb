    "### What is Cloud Microphysics?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the atmosphere, _microphysics_ refers to the microscale processes that affect cloud and precipitation particles and is a key linkage among the various components of Earth's atmospheric water and energy cycles. The representation of microphysical processes in models continues to pose a major challenge leading to uncertainty in numerical weather forecasts and climate simulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main question we pose is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- how to represent the population of cloud and precipitation particles, given the impossibility of simulating all particles individually within a cloud?\n",
    "\n",
    "Models that attempt at describing _all_ micro processes in clouds can be extremely complex. See the following sketch: \n",

    "For this workshop, we will use a so-called \"bulk model\" or \"method of moments\", i.e., a model that treats the cloud as a continuum and tries to predict cumulative quantities, such as the total mass of rain or snow produced in a cloud.\n",

    "**Solution:** A falling drop will collect a cylinder volume of air $V = A h$, where $A$ is the area of the base of the cylinder and $h$ its height. We can substitute $h$ with the actual distance travelled by a falling drop with 1D velocity ($|\\boldsymbol{v}|/\\Delta t \\equiv v / \\Delta t$), and we will get $V = A v/\\Delta t$.\n",

We will define these below.\n",

But in a leaf-like fall, the reference cross-sectional area will change its orientation with respect to the direction of motion, changing angles of inclination with respect to the ground, and the variations of these angles might not be constant in time.\n",
